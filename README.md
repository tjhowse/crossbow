## Project status

The design is currently buildable, but requires paper shims and some finesse
to load and fire. It's currently missing:

* Wood-based alternative to the trigger and sear pivot points,
* Cosmetics.

## Building

The design is highly sensitive to the thickness of the plywood used. Measure
your ply and plug the dimension (in mm) to the body_ply_thickness variable
to ensure everything's nice and snug. There are DXFs in this repo for 2.85mm
and 3mm ply.
