## Project status

The design is currently buildable, but requires paper shims and some finesse
to load and fire. It's currently missing:

* Arm to hold the bolt in place and guide the string,
* Spring-return for the trigger and sear,
* More robust mechanism to keep the bow in the correct position,
* Cosmetics.

## Building

The design is highly sensitive to the thickness of the plywood used. Measure
your ply and plug the dimension (in mm) to the body_ply_thickness variable
to ensure everything's nice and snug. The DXF in this repo assumes 3mm thick
plywood.
